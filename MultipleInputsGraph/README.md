# Multiple Inputs Graph

A graph where you pass in a single list of integers along with a name and an operation. If the operation is a `+`, you **add** the elements and if it's a `*`, you **multilply** the elements, **all within the same node.**

# Example

`Input`:

```
{"name": "Jack Sparrow", "values": [1, 2, 3, 4], "operation": "*"}
```

`Output`:

```
"Hi Jack Sparrow, your answer is: 24"
```
