# Multiple Nodes Graph

A Graph that accepts a user's name, age, and a list of their skills. It passes the state through three nodes that:
* Personalizes the name field with a greeting.
* Describes the user's age
* List the user's skills in a formatted string.
* 
The final output in the result field should be a combined message in this format:

`Output`: ```Linda, welcome to the system! You are 31 years old! You have skills in Python, ML, React.```
